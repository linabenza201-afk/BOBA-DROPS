        <h1>Hello, guys!</h1>
        <p>Boba tea originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s when tapioca pearls were added to cold tea. The drink's exact creation is attributed to two main businesses: Chun Shui Tang Tea Room's manager, Lin Hsiu Hui, who added sweetened tapioca balls (fen yuan) to tea in 1988, and Hanlin Tea Room's owner, Tu Zonghe, who also added tapioca pearls to green tea around 1986. The drink, known for its chewy "bubbles" made of tapioca, quickly spread globally and became a popular phenomenon. </p>

        <p>The main ingredients in boba are tapioca pearls, a tea-based beverage (such as black or green tea), milk (animal or vegetable) for creaminess, and a sweetener (sugar, syrup). You can also add flavorings, fruit syrups, flavored powders, or fruit pearls (popping boba) to vary the flavors and textures, using a wide straw for sipping.
</p>
<p>The average price for a boba drink typically ranges from $3 to $7, though this can vary significantly based on location, size, ingredients, and additional toppings, with specialty drinks or those in expensive areas costing more. A standard cup of milk tea with tapioca pearls often falls within the $4 to $6 range, while adding toppings like jellies or pudding can increase the price by $0.50 to $1 per item. </p>
